# Alternative Language Assignment

## Language Choice
I chose to use Java as I was already familar with the language. I have a pretty extensive knowledge of Java, Python, C and C++. I used Java 1.8.0_391. I used the Eclipse IDE as I had had past experience with it and my enviroment was already set up. I also have used JUnit in the past and had it configured on the IDE as well. Java is a Object Oriented Programming language and I have had experience using the Extends and Include keywords. I have also used HashMaps in Java before and those were recommended to be used in this project. File IO was also something I was experienced with and knew would be easy in Java.

Java handles OOP programming extremely well as it is strictly object-oriented, designed from the ground up with the philosophy that everything should be an object.
Java handles file ingestion and IO extremely well and easily with the FileReader class.
Conditional statements, assignment statements and loops are a staple of any OOP programming language and Java is no exception. I used for loops, if statements and switch statements in this project.
Java has classes, subclasses, methods and functions. And I used all of these in this project.
Java has a tool called JUnit for unit testing that I have used in previous classes. I used JUnit to run Unit Tests and EclEmma for Code Coverage. I had 93% code coverage from my package.

Java also has great exception handling and the 7% of the code that was not covered by EclEmma were the exception handling I included in case of failures in User or File data.

I considered using libraries such as Apache Commons CSV or OpenCSV for parsing the cells.csv file but decided to do manual parsing instead as the CSV input data was consistant throughout the CSV file. I used the java.util package in almost every one of my classes and I used the java.io package in my CSVReader class.
